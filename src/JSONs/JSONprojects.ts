      "We started interviewing a selected group of real estate experts to map the expert's User Journey.",
      'Until that point, there was no defined methodology for work. Each expert used different tools to do the same job, contacted clients through various channels, and there was no defined script for talking to potential clients nor any follow-up after the initial contact, among other issues.',
      'All interviews were conducted virtually with experts from Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. While we gathered answers, many new questions also arose.',
      'The key discovery was that the proposal served as a property display. Clients would select properties they liked and schedule visits with the expert. Thus, the proposal needed a feature for scheduling appointments.',
      'Experts emphasized the importance of highlighting certain parts of the proposal, such as images and property prices, as clients often discard properties if the price isn‚Äôt right. Additionally, for new projects, the completion date was crucial to include in the proposal design.',
